```bash
node --version
```

### Create a `.env` File :lock:

The project should have a `.env` file to store the environment secrets. You may create a file named `.env` (no extensions) directly in your project root folder either from the GUI File Explorer (Windows) or from your CLI (Mac/Linux) with `touch .env`.

Paste the contents of the `.env` file as shared securely directly into the file and save it.
